/**
 * Computes the effective certificate chain from the raw array returned by Java's built in TLS APIs.
 * Cleaning a chain returns a list of certificates where the first element is {@code chain[0]}, each
 * certificate is signed by the certificate that follows, and the last certificate is a trusted CA
 * certificate.
 *
 * <p>Use of the chain cleaner is necessary to omit unexpected certificates that aren't relevant to
 * the TLS handshake and to extract the trusted CA certificate for the benefit of certificate
 * pinning.
