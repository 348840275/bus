/**
 * A non-blocking interface to a web socket. Use the {@linkplain WebSocket.Factory factory} to
 * create instances; usually this is {@link HttpClient}.
 *
 * <h3>Web Socket Lifecycle</h3>
 * <p>
 * Upon normal operation each web socket progresses through a sequence of states:
 *
 * <ul>
 * <li><strong>Connecting:</strong> the initial state of each web socket. Messages may be enqueued
 * but they won't be transmitted until the web socket is open.
 * <li><strong>Open:</strong> the web socket has been accepted by the remote peer and is fully
 * operational. Messages in either direction are enqueued for immediate transmission.
 * <li><strong>Closing:</strong> first of the peers on the web socket has initiated a graceful
 * shutdown. The web socket will continue to transmit already-enqueued messages but will
 * refuse to enqueue new ones.
 * <li><strong>Closed:</strong> the web socket has transmitted all of its messages and has
 * received all messages from the peer.
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * Web sockets may fail due to HTTP upgrade problems, connectivity problems, or if either peer
 * chooses to short-circuit the graceful shutdown process:
 *
 * <ul>
 * <li><strong>Canceled:</strong> the web socket connection failed. Messages that were
 * successfully enqueued by either peer may not have been transmitted to the other.
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * Note that the state progression is independent for each peer. Arriving at a gracefully-closed
 * state indicates that a peer has sent all of its outgoing messages and received all of its
 * incoming messages. But it does not guarantee that the other peer will successfully receive all of
 * its incoming messages.
