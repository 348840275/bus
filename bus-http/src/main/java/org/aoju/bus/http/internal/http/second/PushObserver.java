/**
 * {@link Protocol#HTTP_2 HTTP/2} only. Processes server-initiated HTTP requests on the client.
 * Implementations must quickly dispatch callbacks to avoid creating a bottleneck.
 *
 * <p>While {@link #onReset} may occur at any time, the following callbacks are expected in order,
 * correlated by stream ID.
 *
 * <ul>
 * <li>{@link #onRequest}</li> <li>{@link #onHeaders} (unless canceled)
 * <li>{@link #onData} (optional sequence of data frames)
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>As a stream ID is scoped to a single HTTP/2 connection, implementations which target multiple
 * connections should expect repetition of stream IDs.
 *
 * <p>Return true to request cancellation of a pushed stream.  Note that this does not guarantee
 * future frames won't arrive on the stream ID.
